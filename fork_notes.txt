This is notes for fork created of projects 

In github person creating the repository(owner of repo) only has power to make any changes to repository if someone wants to contribute any change he/she will have to create a fork in his/her own account and make changes and then submit a pull request to propose their changes

git clone <repo link> -->> this will create a clone of your github repo link on your local storage

The upstream URL in GitHub refers to the URL of the original repository from which a fork was created. When you fork a repository and clone it to your local machine, 
the cloned repository only points to your fork. To keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, you need to add the original repository (upstream) as a remote.

we cannot push our code to upstream url from fork we push it 1st to our forked repo from there we create a pull request to original repo 

we push fork as branch to original repository, where it is reviewed and merged with main branch

git fetch upstream -->> this command will fetch the updates in original repo and store it in background waiting to be updated in local storage 
git merge upstream/main -->> this command will update main branch of fork repo with latest changes in original repository
